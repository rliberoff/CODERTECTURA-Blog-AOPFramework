I do not pretend that this "AOP Framework" is the fastest, the leanest, the 
smallest or the best, I just pretend that it does exactly what I planned it to do, 
and that it does it well enough for me. I hope it does the same for you, and if it 
happens that you were able to improve it… just let me know.
